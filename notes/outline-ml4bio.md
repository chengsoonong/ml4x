- Generalization from Ribosome Binding Site to other regulatory sequences
- Measurement Noise and Data Normalisation
- Exploration-Exploitation tradeoff in bandits
- Representation of Biological sequences
- Evaluation and Interpretability
- Interdisciplinary Collaboration

## WCB ICML 2017 keynote: Why is ML for Comp Bio hard?

Deep data
- High dimensional low sample size data
- Finite domain (we want predictions genome wide)
- Difficult to satisfy i.i.d. assumption

Prior knowledge
- Hard and soft constraints
- Weak constraints
- Causal systems with feedback and delays

Different problems/communities
- Genomics, proteomics, medical imaging, health records
- Communication challenges
